# Multi-Agent Architecture for AI Use Case Generation
# System Architecture Overview
The system consists of three main agents working together:

1. Industry Research Agent - Researches company/industry information
2. Use Case Generation Agent - Analyzes trends and creates relevant use cases
3. Resource Asset Collection Agent - Finds datasets and resources for implementation

Here's how these agents will work together:

1. User inputs a company or industry name
2. Industry Research Agent gathers information about the company/industry
3. Use Case Generation Agent takes this information to create relevant AI use cases
4. Resource Asset Collection Agent finds supporting datasets and implementation resources
5. The system compiles all information into a final proposal
