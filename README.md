# Multi-Agent Architecture for AI Use Case Generation
# System Architecture Overview
The system consists of three main agents working together:

Industry Research Agent - Researches company/industry information
Use Case Generation Agent - Analyzes trends and creates relevant use cases
Resource Asset Collection Agent - Finds datasets and resources for implementation

Here's how these agents will work together:

User inputs a company or industry name
Industry Research Agent gathers information about the company/industry
Use Case Generation Agent takes this information to create relevant AI use cases
Resource Asset Collection Agent finds supporting datasets and implementation resources
The system compiles all information into a final proposal
